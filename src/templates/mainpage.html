    Things to note,<br>
    The file is a wav file but I havn't figured out
    what's wrong with mime types so you'll have to add the ".wav"
    yourself.<br>
    The file still has all the html in it so Mr. Robot voice will be
    reading lots of html and html escape sequences to you. This will
    be fixed soon.<br>
    I'm working on getting a better voice.<br>
